<h1 align="center"> MockFeed</h1>
<p align="center">A small app developed by me that clones the news feed of any popular social media app.<br>
MockFeed currently contains the news feed with 10 posts, a navigation drawer and an activity with the details of any opened post.<br>
More update may come in the future to make it into a proper clone.<br><br>
I made this app in order to improve my knowledge I had acquired over the past about the android platform. This app includes almost everything of whatever I have learned till now, 
that includes, recyclerview, shared animation transitions, toolbar, navigation drawers and more.<br>
The data in the posts are from real people I found on linkedin.</p>
